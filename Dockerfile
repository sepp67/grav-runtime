# The apk nginx package ships /var/lib/nginx as nginx:nginx mode 0750, and
# /var/lib/nginx/tmp as nginx:nginx mode 0700. Workers run as www-data
# (docker/nginx.conf "user www-data;"), which is neither the owner nor in
# the nginx group, so it lacks the traversal bit on /var/lib/nginx itself
# — nginx fails to buffer any request body (uploads, large POSTs) with
# "open() ... Permission denied" and returns a 500 before PHP-FPM is ever
# reached. Both levels need to be traversable/writable by www-data.

# The official zip also ships demo/starter content (pages, stock site and
# system config) directly under user/ — exactly the directories this
# runtime treats as persistent/seedable (§10-11 of the design). That content
# is stripped below so the image keeps only the generic technical layer
# (user/themes, user/plugins); pages/accounts/data/config start empty.
